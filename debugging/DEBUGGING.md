# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: **Debugging Get All Employees Flow**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`, line 43 - 51 (`getAllEmployees` function)
- **Objective:** Investigate how the system retrieves and returns all employee data when a `GET` request is made to fetch all employees.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `employees`: Contains the list of all employees retrieved from the database.
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `getAllEmployees` in `employeeService.ts` to fetch all employee data.
  - After retrieving the employee data, the response is sent back to the client.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - The debugger shows that `employees` contains the expected list of employee data before the response is sent.
  - The API responds with a `200` status and the list of employees.

### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - I confirmed that the retrieval of all employees works as expected, and the API correctly returns the employee data.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No unexpected behavior was observed during the retrieval process.

- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - I could consider adding pagination or limiting the number of employees returned to improve performance, especially when the dataset grows large.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helped solidify how employee data is fetched and returned in the system, and how controllers handle API responses.

## Scenario 2: **Debugging Employee Deletion Process**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`, line 137 - 147 (`deleteEmployee` function)
- **Objective:** Debug the employee deletion flow to see how the `DELETE` request is handled, and observe the result when attempting to delete a non-existing employee.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `deleted`: Boolean indicating whether the employee was successfully deleted.
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `deleteEmployee` in `employeeService.ts` with the employee ID to remove the employee.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - The debugger shows that if the employee ID is valid, the `deleted` variable is set to `true`.
  - If the employee does not exist, `deleted` is `false`, and a 404 response is returned.
  
### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - I confirmed that the deletion process works as expected, and the API correctly handles cases where the employee does not exist.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No, the behavior was expected. However, it's important to handle cases where no employee is found in a user-friendly manner.

- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - Adding more error handling around potential database issues could improve the robustness of the system.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helped me understand how to manage deletion in RESTful APIs and handle cases where the item to be deleted does not exist.

## Scenario 3: **Debugging the Update Employee Flow**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeController.ts`, line 107 - 117 (`updateEmployee` function)
- **Objective:** Investigate how the system handles the updating of employee data when a `PUT` request is made with new employee data.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `updatedEmployee`: The employee data after it has been updated.
  - `employeeId`: The ID of the employee being updated.
  - `newData`: The new employee data from the `req.body`.
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `updateEmployee` in `employeeService.ts` with the `employeeId` and `newData` to update the employee record.
  - After updating, the response is sent back to the client with the updated employee data.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - The debugger shows that the `updatedEmployee` contains the modified employee data after the `updateEmployee` service function is called.
  - The API responds with a `200` status and the updated employee data.
  - If the employee ID is invalid or not found, a `404` response is returned.

### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - I confirmed that the employee update process works as expected, and the API correctly returns the updated employee data.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No unexpected behavior was observed. The update operation behaves as expected when a valid employee ID is provided.
  
- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - I could add more validation checks to ensure that all necessary fields are provided and are in the correct format before updating the employee data.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario deepened my understanding of how updates are handled in the system, particularly in managing existing employee records and ensuring data integrity during modifications.
