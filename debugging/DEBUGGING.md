# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: **Validation Logic - Creating a Branch with Missing Fields**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branchService.ts`, line 18 (`createBranch` function)
- **Objective:** Ensure that the validation logic correctly rejects incomplete or invalid branch data.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `branchData = { name: "Test Branch" }` (Missing `address` and `phone`)
  - `validationResult.error = "Address is required"`
  - `thrownError = ValidationError("Address is required")`
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `createBranch` in `branchService.ts` with incomplete branch data.
  - The `validationResult.error` triggers validation failure due to missing required fields (e.g., `address` and `phone`).

- **Behavior:**
  - The validation correctly identifies the missing `address` field and throws a `ValidationError`.

### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The validation logic is working as expected, and the system correctly throws an error when required fields are missing.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No, the behavior is as expected. However, additional logging could improve the debugging process.

- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - Consider improving error messages to specify all missing fields at once, instead of stopping at the first missing field.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario reinforced how validation works in the system and the importance of handling input validation before performing database operations.

## Scenario 2: **Updating a Branch - Ensuring Partial Updates Work Correctly**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `branchService.ts`, line 60 (`updateBranch` function)
- **Objective:** Ensure that partial updates to a branch work as expected, and only the fields provided are updated.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `branchData = { id: "1", name: "Updated Branch", address: "New Address" }` (Partial data)
  - `existingBranch = { id: "1", name: "Old Branch", address: "Old Address", phone: "123-456-7890" }` (Existing branch data)
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `updateBranch` with the partial data (`name` and `address`), and Firestore's `updateDocument` is executed.
  - The `updateDocument` function updates only the `name` and `address` fields, leaving other fields unchanged.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - The debugger shows that only the `name` and `address` fields are updated in Firestore, while the `phone` remains unchanged.
  - The response contains the updated `branchData` with the provided fields (`name` and `address`).

### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - Partial updates are working as expected, where only the fields provided in the request are updated in Firestore, and other fields are left unchanged.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No unexpected behavior was observed, the update correctly only affects the provided fields.

- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - Consider validating the presence of at least one field to update. This ensures that partial updates are meaningful and not empty.
  
- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario confirmed that partial updates function as intended, and understanding how Firestore handles update operations at the field level helps in controlling what data is updated.

## Scenario 3: **Handling NotFoundError for Employee Retrieval**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `employeeService.ts`, line 51 (`getEmployeeById` function)
- **Objective:** Ensure that the system handles the `NotFoundError` correctly when an employee is not found by their ID.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `id = "123"` (The employee ID being queried)
  - `snapshot.empty = true` (No employee found in the database for the given ID)
  - `thrownError = NotFoundError("Employee with ID '123' not found.")`
  
- **Call Stack:**
  - The controller calls `getEmployeeById` with the ID `"123"`.
  - The `getDocumentsByFieldValue` function queries the database for an employee with the given ID.
  - Since the employee doesn't exist, a `NotFoundError` is thrown with the appropriate error message.
  
- **Behavior:**
  - The `NotFoundError` is correctly thrown, and the error is handled within the `catch` block, where it is rethrown if it's an instance of `NotFoundError`. Other errors are wrapped in a `ServiceError`.

### Analysis:
- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The system correctly handles missing employee data by throwing and handling the `NotFoundError`, ensuring that the proper error is returned when the employee is not found.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior?**
  - No, the behavior is as expected. The error is handled appropriately.

- **Areas for improvement or refactoring?**
  - Consider improving the error handling to log more information, such as the employee ID, to aid in debugging issues when the error occurs.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario reinforced the importance of custom error handling and the ability to handle specific error types like `NotFoundError` to improve clarity and response behavior in the system.
